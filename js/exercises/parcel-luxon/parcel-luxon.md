# Luxon library with the Parcel bundler

The goal of this exercise is to learn how to use the [Luxon](https://moment.github.io/luxon/) library with the [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) bundler.

[Luxon's documentation](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/?id=luxon)

## Instructions

1. initialize a new project with the Parcel bundler
2. install the Luxon library
3. create a `src/index.js` file
   1. use the DateTime object to display the current date and time in a specific format (e.g. "Monday, January 4th, 2021, 3:15pm")
   2. use the Duration object to calculate the difference between two dates, and display the result in a human-readable format (e.g. "3 days, 4 hours, and 20 minutes")
   3. use the Interval object to calculate the difference between two dates, and display the result in a human-readable format (e.g. "3 days, 4 hours, and 20 minutes")
   4. use the setLocale function to change the language of the DateTime object (e.g. "lundi 4 janvier 2021 15:15")
   5. Log the results in the console
