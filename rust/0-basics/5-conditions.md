# Rust lesson 5 - Conditions

## Basic if statements

An if statement in Rust has the following syntax:

``` rust
if condition {
// Code to run if condition is true
}
```

The `condition` is a boolean expression that determines whether the code inside the braces `{}` should be executed. If the condition is `true`, the code is executed. If the condition is `false`, the code is skipped.
