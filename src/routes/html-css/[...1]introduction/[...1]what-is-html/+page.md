**HTML**, which stands for *HyperText Markup Language*, is the standard markup language used to create web pages. It provides the structure of a webpage and uses tags to define elements like headings, paragraphs, links, images, and more. **HTML** is not a programming language but a document markup language that defines the structure and layout of web documents. It forms the foundation of any web page and is essential for creating web content that can be displayed in a web browser.

**HTML** consists of a series of elements, which are represented by tags. Tags are enclosed in angle brackets (`<>`) and typically come in pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag. Some tags, called empty elements, do not require a closing tag. **HTML** tags tell the browser how to display the content and how to apply styles to it.

For example, here's a simple **HTML** document:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>This is a Heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<p>This is another paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>
```

In this example:
- `<!DOCTYPE html>` declares the document type and version of HTML.
- `<html>` is the root element of an HTML page.
- `<head>` contains meta-information about the document, such as its title.
- `<title>` specifies a title for the document, shown in the browser's title bar or tab.
- `<body>` contains the visible page content.
- `<h1>` defines a large heading.
- `<p>` defines a paragraph.

**HTML** is supported by all web browsers and is essential for web development, often used in conjunction with **CSS** (Cascading Style Sheets) for styling and **JavaScript** for adding interactivity.
